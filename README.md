## Install of Python

All of the packages below should work with any Python distribution.

However, they are all easiest to install if you use the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). An alternative (and much smaller to download) is the [miniconda installer](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), which is the Anaconda distribution without several pre-installed packages.
