# Python for Variable Star Astronomy

The talk slides are [here](craig-aavso-fall-2017.pdf).

## Links to online (no install necessary) Jupyter notebook examples

+ A few short example from an observational astronomy course: https://goo.gl/RG4uLg

## Install Python

All of the packages below should work with any Python distribution.

However, they are all easiest to install if you use the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). An alternative (and much smaller to download) is the [miniconda installer](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), which is the Anaconda distribution without several pre-installed packages.

## Links to software

The installation instructions below are for the Anaconda (or miniconda) Python distribution. For other Python distributions you can replace `conda` with `pip` to install the software.
